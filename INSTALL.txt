Harvest is normally distributed as a binary with Parsnp.

Dependencies:
-------------
   - Autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
   - Protocol Buffers ( https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ )
   - Cap'n Proto ( https://capnproto.org/ )
   - Zlib ( http://www.zlib.net/, included with OS X and most Linuxes )


Steps:
------
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure [--prefix=...] [--with-protobuf=...]  [--with-capnp=...]
   make
   [sudo] make install


Products:
---------
   - command line tool ( <prefix>/bin/harvest )
   - static library ( <prefix>/lib/libharvest.a )
   - includes ( <prefix>/include/harvest/ )


Deployment:
-----------
OSX
  HarvestTools can be built on any OSX version starting with 10.7 (using
  XCode >= 4.6), and the binary should work across the same range of versions,
  regardless of the particular version it was built with.
Linux
  HarvestTools must be built with at least GCC 4.8 due to its c++11 dependency.
  However, the resulting binary can run on Linux with older GCC libraries if
  libstdc++ is linked statically. To do this, ensure that you have a statically
  built library (libstdc++.a) and add "-static-libstdc++" to $CPPFLAGS before
  running "make". You may also need to use "-L <dir>"in $CPPFLAGS to tell GCC
  where to find libstdc++.a.


Notes:
------
* When running ./configure, use --prefix to install somewhere other than
  /usr/local.
* Sudo will be necessary for 'make install' if write permission
  is not available in --prefix (e.g. by default).
* Use --with-protobuf=...  or --with-capnp=... if the Protocol Buffer or Cap'n
  Proto libraries are not in the default location (/usr/local). These should be
  absolute paths and should not include "bin" or "lib".
* If Zlib is not installed in a standard system location (it usually is),
  CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS will have to be modified before making.
