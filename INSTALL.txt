Harvest is normally distributed as a binary with Parsnp.

Dependencies:
-------------
   - Autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
   - Protocol Buffers ( https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ )
   - Cap'n Proto ( https://capnproto.org/ )
   - Zlib ( http://www.zlib.net/, included with OS X and most Linuxes )


Steps:
------
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure [--prefix=...] [--with-protobuf=...]  [--with-capnp=...]
   make
   [sudo] make install


Products:
---------
   - command line tool ( <prefix>/bin/harvest )
   - static library ( <prefix>/lib/libharvest.a )
   - includes
      - Harvest, Protocol Buffer message class ( <prefix>/include/harvest.pb.h )
      - HarvestIO, Harvest wrapper with file IO ( <prefix>/include/HarvestIO.h )


Notes:
------
* When running ./configure, use --prefix to install somewhere other than
  /usr/local.
* Sudo will be necessary for 'make install' if write permission
  is not available in --prefix (e.g. by default).
* Use --with-protobuf=...  or --with-capnp=... if the Protocol Buffer or Cap'n
  Proto libraries are not in the default location (/usr/local). These should be
  absolute paths and should not include "bin" or "lib".
* If Zlib is not installed in a standard system location (it usually is),
  CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS will have to be modified before making.
